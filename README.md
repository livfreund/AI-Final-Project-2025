# AI-Final-Project-2025

In fall of 2025 at Boston Unviversity, I took a course called Artifical Intelliegence. For our final project, our professor gave us the freedom to use any aspect of artificial intelligence we've learned in class to accomplish a task. My partner, Jack Vanourny, and I chose to use an algorithm called "Dancing Links" to solve any sodoku problem.
